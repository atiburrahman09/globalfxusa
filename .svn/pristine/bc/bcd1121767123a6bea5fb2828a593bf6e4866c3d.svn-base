                                A express commission is what you pay to the person who provides you a lead. It's not a requirement,
                                it's a courtesy, although some people won't provide leads without the promise of a express commission.
                                Express commission are most common between professionalism.

                                Binary are characterized by having two legs, and only two legs. This makes them very simple.
                                You will get commissions on your weak leg only – the smaller leg that has less volume. 
                                This keeps most people focused on building their weak leg, which is also known as the pay leg in a binary. 
                                You will get 10% pair commission on your weak leg.

                    <p>Risk Warning: Trading on financial markets carries risks. Contracts for Difference (‘CFDs’) 
                        are complex financial products that are traded on margin. Trading CFDs carries a high level 
                        of risk since leverage can work both to your advantage and disadvantage. As a result, CFDs may not be suitable for all
                        investors because you may lose all your invested capital. You should not risk more than you are prepared to lose.
                        Before deciding to trade, you need to ensure that you understand the risks involved taking into account your investment 
                        objectives and level of experience
